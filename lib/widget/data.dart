String intro =
    '''Created by Santoshi Tajiri, the idea of Pokémon came from the concept of bug catching. This makes up one half the the goal in almost every iteration of Pokémon.  Part 1 is to collect as many Pokémon as possible. Players can do that by catching Pokémon in the wild, via trading and through evolution of a particular species. Part 2 is to train the caught Pokémon though Pokémon battles. The higher the level of your Pokémon, the better your chances at beating other Pokémon trainers, Gym leaders and eventually the Pokémon League.
